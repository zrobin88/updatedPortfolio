Updated portfoilio 


Welcome to my updated Protfolio! Here you will find all things Zack :) 

The home page consits of general infomation about myself with links to my github, linkedin and a downloadable PDF of my resume. 

The portfolio page consists of links to the deployed versions of the various applications that I have worked on thus far.

Current Apps and How to use them:

    1- Concerto: Concerto is an application for fans of music and concert-goers. Input the
              name of any band (or artist) and the app will return general information about the band/artist, the top
              ten tracks, two similar artists and upcoming live evetns with the option to purchase tickets. This application works by utlizing the Last.FM and ticketmaster API's.

    2 - Metal Band Name Generator: Being an avid heavy metal fan (and musician), this was a fun app to work on. The app is a simple name generator that pulls random indexes from two arrays for a two-word name and one index from a single arry for one-word-names. I also performed and recorded the muisc in the background (guitar, bass and drums).

    3 - GIF Madness: This application contains a series of "topic-buttons" that when clicked, populate the page with GIF's pertaining to the topic. This is done through GIPHY's API and Ajax calls. Als0, GIF's are set to animate when the user clicks on them. The app also allows the user to type in a topic and the app will dynamically generate a GIF button based upon the user's input. Go ahed and give it a try.

    4 - Train Scheduler: This application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The contact section includes a form where you can drop me some lines that I can actually see! The form is connected to firebase so anything that is submitted is sent to my database. There is also my general contact information with an active linkedin profile badge. 

Be sure to check out the sweet favicon of my company logo as well!
